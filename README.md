## Project Overview
The increasing complexity of software systems demands effective methods for understanding and maintaining source codes. In this context, traceability links between software artifacts, such as requirements, code, and documentation, play a crucial role in facilitating software comprehension, maintenance, and evolution. This project focuses on developing a comprehensive framework for automated trace link generation between use case documents and Java code files, leveraging machine learning techniques and natural language processing (NLP) tools.

The project comprises several modules, each serving a specific purpose in the traceability link generation process. The Data Collection Module retrieves and preprocesses relevant data, including use case documents, Java code files, and associated metadata. The Feature Extraction Module extracts features from both textual and code-based sources, capturing essential information for link prediction. Subsequently, the Model Prediction Module applies machine learning algorithms, such as Random Forest, to predict trace links based on the extracted features, as well as the Deep Learning Prediction Module for benchmarking the machine learning outputs. Additionally, the Bug Localization Module aims to locate buggy versions of code files by analyzing bug reports and version control data.

Throughout the development process, various software tools and technologies are employed, including Visual Studio Code, Python, Jupyter Notebook, TensorFlow, and TreeSitting. These tools facilitate tasks such as code editing, data analysis, machine learning model training, and parsing source code. Furthermore, libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn provide essential functionalities for data manipulation, numerical computing, and machine learning tasks.

The proposed framework contributes to the automation of traceability link generation, reducing manual effort, and improving software maintenance efficiency. By establishing trace links between use case documents and code files, developers can better understand system requirements, track changes, and ensure consistency between software artifacts. Overall, this project aims to enhance software comprehension and maintenance processes, ultimately leading to the development of more reliable and maintainable software systems.
